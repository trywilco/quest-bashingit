learningObjectives: 
- Writing bash scripts
hints:
- In order to allow someone else to use your script you would want to make it exectutable. You can find instructions here [link](https://www.andrewcbancroft.com/blog/musings/make-bash-script-executable/)
- To get arguments in your bash script you can use the following [link](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/use-command-line-arguments-in-bash-script)
- It's always a good idea to make sure you don't have any redundant characters (including spaces or \n).
