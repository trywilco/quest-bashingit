id: bash_filter
learningObjectives: 
- Recognise a correct file format that can be manipulated through bash. Read from a file and learn at least one bash command that can search it for a specific string or symbol
hints:
- Some file formats can not be manipulated through bash
- If you are not sure how to use a command you can use the manual. Type 'man nameOfCommand' for example, man cat would open the manual for the cat command
- You can use several commands together by utilizing the sign | (pipe)
- Not sure everybody knows to spell their emails with lower case letters

We have mole hunts, like, every week. Comes with the popularity, I guess. My advice for you is to create some sort of a script, because it aint gonna be a one-time thing. From what I remember, bash can be very effective for these kinds of small tasks."
